# Tech Prioritization quiz
### Objective

Propel engineer thinking, foster problem solving skills, encourage technical team interaction, sculpt business acumen w/ technical focus.

### Description
Trainer will walk students through a technical prioritization exercise.  In a gist, the students will prioritize a list of technical stories/tasks and discuss reasoning with classroom.

This exercise can be done in a group setting, individually, split into teams; depends on required pace.

### Example Student instructions
1. 1 person volunteer.  Write the printed list on a whiteboard for eventual discussion.
2. individually, prioritize your printed list (writing numbers next to each item)
3. note the technical parts involved for each item (client, server, design, data, ui, ux, ?)

keep in mind, there is no right or wrong answer, ask questions.  We will walk through everyone's reasoning together afterwords as a group.  Once everyone is finished, we will prioritize the list together on the whiteboard.  Be prepared to justify your reasoning from an technical/engineering perspective.

### Student Tips
1. shift your perspective from technical to non-technical and vice versa
2. question the value of item as it applies to: 'keep the customer at the center of our financial lives'
3. attempt to understand the technical details of item
4. value the impact item may have from an engineering perspective

### List to prioritize
- login ECMAScript error
- page load is slow
- customer/client complaining about functionality
- random data error
- remember the last what's new modal a user has seen
- build a net-worth overtime card for summary
- improve page performance on summary
- migrate off of jenkins to gitlab CI pipeline
- migrate legacy NMC services to micro-services

#### Trainer instructions & notes
- Write the list on a whiteboard or ask for volunteer.  On paper can work, but if the students stand up or a volunteer stands up, it can change the pace of the classroom.
- Ask the students to order/prioritize the list, writing numbers next to each item (if done as a group), or on paper individually.  Encourage questions.
- Remind them there is no right or wrong answer, and that they can ask questions, and they will walk you through their reasoning afterwards.
- Discuss the students reasoning
- Be happy and delighted during the exercise.

##### Questons for discussion
- Ask to explain reasoning
- Ask why an item is first
- Ask why an item is last
- Ask why an item is not important
- Ask follow up questions to their answers
- Ask questions & whys to dig deeper into reasoning for particular items
- Ask questions to facilitate finding out more about what we are looking for (depends on list, students)

##### Observe & Assess
Look for Data Driven Thinking (asking for data about items, caring about Data vs Opinion)
Look for UX Empathy (caring about how things impact our users)
Look for commercial awareness (conscious thinking about business goals/objectives, etc.)
Look for ability to investigate, question, validate
Look for Technical preferences, abilities
